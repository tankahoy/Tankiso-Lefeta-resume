### PhD chapter abstracts
#### **The Effect of a public housing subsidy programme on child development among low-income households in South Africa**
Impaired physical linear growth during childhood, particularly stunting, drives wedges among individuals in
terms of cognitive development, educational outcomes, future earning potential, productivity levels, and susceptibility
to various diseases. This condition can also perpetuate cycles of intergenerational malnutrition, thereby exacerbating
health inequalities and economic disadvantage across populations. Globally, over 145 million children under five are
stunted (i.e., height-for-age Z-score less than -2 standard deviations from the WHO child growth standards median), and
the rate of decline has been unacceptably slow. The burden of this issue is more pronounced in Southern Asia and sub￾Saharan Africa, where many communities remain impoverished. While inadequate nutrition has long been recognised
as a primary cause of stunting, recent scholarly discourse has shifted focus towards “net nutrition”, which takes into
account the nutritional resources that can be absorbed and utilised by the body while factoring in the losses incurred
due to illness and physical activity. This perspective highlights the complex interplay between dietary intake and various
environmental variables that can enhance or obstruct nutritional absorption. One critical yet underexplored environmental
determinant is housing. Despite its importance as a factor influencing well-being, little research has been conducted to
assess the causal impact of access to adequate housing on child growth and development. To address this gap, this
study provides empirical evidence of the causal effects that the provision of public housing has on child linear growth
outcomes (height-for-age z-score and stunting) for children in low-income households. In particular, using the five waves
of the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) spanning 2008-2017, I examine the impact of providing access to better
housing for low-income households living in informal dwellings in major metropolitan areas of South Africa. I employ a
Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity (FRD) design within a Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) framework—henceforth called
“SEM-fuzzy”—to experimentally evaluate the impact of a large-scale, means-tested benefit, public housing programme in
South Africa, known as the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), which provides low-cost government subsidised houses to households based on a specific income threshold, with households earning less than ZAR 3,501 per
month deemed eligible for free public housing assistance. The programme’s main objective is to provide access to adequate
housing and improve the well-being of marginalised communities. The study yields four main findings. First, I observe
a positive and significant effect of RDP housing eligibility on receiving the RDP housing subsidy. Second, receiving an
RDP subsidy increases the likelihood of living in a formal house for eligible households who receive the housing subsidy.
Third, the full SEM-fuzzy model demonstrates a significant link between access to formal housing and reduced stunting
risk, along with improved height-for-age for children in complier households close to the eligibility threshold. Lastly,
drawing upon established epidemiological literature, I explore the underlying mechanisms at play and find that, at the
eligibility cutoff, occupying a formal house is strongly associated with a heightened probability of utilising electricity for cooking (a proxy for indoor air quality), which correlates significantly with a decrease in stunting probability, though the effect on height-for-age averages remains statistically insignificant. The validity of these findings is confirmed through several robustness checks. Overall, this study underscores the critical role of access to adequate housing in mitigating environmental risk factors associated with poor child growth and development in impoverished communities, advocating for an expansion of existing frameworks—such as the WHO conceptual framework of stunting—to incorporate housing and indoor air pollution as integral components of interventions designed to alleviate stunting, in conjunction with nutritional and WASH factors.

### **Estimating the effect of in-utero exposure to air pollution on child birth weight using the sensitivity of OMI-derived NO2 to thermal inversions** 
The timing of exposure to air pollutants during pregnancy has been shown to influence fetal growth and birth outcomes. Recent studies have predominantly focused on particulate matter (PM2.5), with additional research examining other pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), highlighting their adverse effects on fetal
development, birth weight and low birth weight. While the trimester-specific impacts of these “criteria” pollutants have
been well-documented, there has been less emphasis on studying the trimester-specific effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a highly reactive component of nitrogen oxides (NOX). Despite being classified as a “criteria” air pollutant, there is relatively little empirical evidence on the trimester-specific effects of NO2 exposure on fetal growth and birth weight. To address this gap, my study examines the trimester-specific effect of in-utero NO2 exposure on birth weight and the probability of having Low Birth Weight (birth weight < 2500g) using data from South Africa. I integrate satellite NO2 data and relevant meteorological data with the geo-coded 2016 Demographic and Health Survey of South Africa. To isolate the causal influence of in-utero NO2 exposure, I use an instrumental variable (IV) approach based on the meteorological phenomenon known as thermal inversions, which induce non-anthropogenic variations in ambient air pollution levels at ground level. First, I show that in each trimester of pregnancy, there is a strong relationship between thermal inversion episodes and levels of exposure to NO2 . Second, the findings suggest that a one-standard-deviation increase in thermal-inversion induced NO2 exposure during the third trimester of pregnancy leads to a relative decrease in birth weight of 0.22 standard deviations and is linked to a 4.7 percentage point increase in the likelihood of low birth weight. The heterogeneity analyses show that male infants are more adversely affected by NO2 exposure, with geographic disparities indicating heightened risks in rural areas. The observed impact of NO2 exposure on infant sex aligns with existing literature indicating that male fetuses may be more vulnerable to environmental stressors during gestation. Additionally, the study revealed a strong link between NO2 exposure and reduced birth weight in rural areas, highlighting the significance of addressing air pollution’s health effects on underserved rural populations. These areas often lack air quality monitoring and face challenges such as limited healthcare access, inadequate sanitation, and insufficient water facilities. The research also emphasises the need to understand the unique biological mechanisms through which NO2 affects fetal development, particularly in contrast to the effects of PM2.5. The validity of the findings is confirmed through robustness checks, although limitations exist related to satellite data accuracy and sample size. Overall, the study highlights the importance of incorporating NO2 into prenatal air quality regulations and calls for further investigation into air pollution’s impact in rural settings, shedding light on the intricate interplay of environmental factors and fetal health outcomes.

### ** Do seasonal variations in NO2 exposure during pregnancy contribute to the socioeconomic inequality in birth weight in South Africa? **
Social disparities in birth weights significantly influence lifelong health outcomes and productivity within populations. This study introduces an additional dimension to the socioeconomic disparities in birth weight by examining the impact of ambient environmental factors, specifically prenatal exposure to NO2 during critical fetal development periods. This exposure has the potential to disrupt biological processes associated with fetal growth, thereby exacerbating socioeconomic inequities and perpetuating cycles of disadvantage. Given the seasonal variation in the chemical composition and concentration of air pollutants, alongside individual variability in exposure and biological response, the seasonal context of NO2 exposure warrants investigation. The urgency of this research is amplified by the ongoing effects of climate change, which are poised to alter existing seasonal pollution patterns with significant implications for vulnerable populations and fetal health outcomes. Utilising Recentered Influence Function (RIF) regressions, this study aims to elucidate the relationship between seasonal NO2 exposure and socioeconomic inequalities in birth weight in South Africa. The rationale for investigating the effects of seasonal NO2 exposure during pregnancy is grounded in the established detrimental impacts of prenatal air pollution on fetal development, the inherent seasonal fluctuations in NO2 concentrations, the exacerbated seasonal variability under climate change, and the critical role of socioeconomic factors in both exposure and vulnerability. The findings suggest that targeted reductions in NO2 levels—particularly during winter months when concentrations peak—are a viable strategy for enhancing air quality and mitigating income-related disparities in birth weight in South Africa.
