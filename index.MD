## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
I am a full-time doctoral candidate and research assistant in the Department of Economics at Stellenbosch University. My area of research is health economics, with a particular focus on the complex interplay between environmental factors and socioeconomic determinants in shaping early childhood health outcomes in South Africa. My research investigates the effects of housing conditions, air pollution, and socioeconomic inequalities on growth metrics and birth outcomes. By elucidating these critical relationships, my objective is to provide evidence-based insights that inform health policies and interventions, ultimately aiming to enhance child health in developing countries. I possess expertise in environmental health, geospatial analysis, and advanced econometric techniques, specifically concerning the analysis of air pollution and housing impacts on child health development.
